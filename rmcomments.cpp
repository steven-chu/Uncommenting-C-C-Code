// Task: Write a program that replaces all the comments with white space to make the code much easier to read.
// How to run?: Use the command `vimdiff wordcount.cpp <(./rmcomments < wordcount.cpp) in Linux system.
// Quick note: This does code does not work completely as it doesn't know how to deal with string literal cases. If I figure it out, I'll come back and add on.
